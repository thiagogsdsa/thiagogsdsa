# Completed Projects

### Operations Research & Optimization

- **[production-mix-optimization](https://github.com/thiagogsdsa/mathematical-optimization-projects/blob/main/Production_Mix_Optimization/READEME.md)**  
  Implementation of a classic linear programming model to optimize the production mix of a factory with resource constraints. The project includes formulating the problem mathematically, solving it using the PuLP library with the CBC solver, and performing sensitivity analysis to interpret shadow prices and slack variables. This project highlights skills in mathematical modeling, applied optimization, and integrating solver tools for practical decision-making in operations research.  
  *Tech:* Python, PuLP, CBC Solver, Linear Programming, Mathematical Modeling, Sensitivity Analysis

### 🤖 NLP & Applied AI

- **[faq-floripa](https://github.com/thiagogsdsa/faq-floripa)** — *A Smart Tourism Assistant Powered by RAG*  
  Developed a Telegram chatbot designed to assist tourists by answering frequently asked questions about Florianópolis. The system leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by retrieving relevant information from structured JSON datasets using sentence embeddings and cosine similarity. It then generates accurate, context-aware responses via the Groq API. This project demonstrates practical application of NLP, vector search, and modern AI APIs to build interactive, knowledge-driven assistants.  
  *Tech:* Python, Docker, Poetry, RAG, Groq API, sentence-transformers, JSON, linear algebra

### 🧹 Data Wrangling & Cleaning

- **[data-wrangling-python](https://github.com/thiagogsdsa/data-wrangling-python)**  
  A comprehensive repository featuring reusable Python scripts and tools aimed at cleaning, transforming, and preprocessing raw datasets efficiently. Focused on enabling data scientists to build robust, reproducible data pipelines and improve productivity in everyday data preparation tasks. This project illustrates best practices in data hygiene and prepares data for downstream analysis or machine learning.  
  *Tech:* Python, Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter Notebooks, Data Pipelines

  ### Future Projects
-  Fraud detection with Graph Neural Networks (GNN) 
-  A project combining Large Language Models (LLM) with optimization (Operations Research) 

### Remark:

> I also have worked on private projects, such as lead qualification and an NLP-based clustering model for grouping similar income statement layouts. Due to confidentiality, these projects cannot be shared publicly.

# 🎨 When Math Meets Art
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thiagogsdsa/math/master/fractals/julia/Buddhabrot/output.gif" alt="Buddhabrot Fractal" />
</p>

While solving real business problems is my main focus — with an emphasis on cloud technologies, deployment, and sharp analytical skills — I also enjoy exploring the artistic side of mathematics in my spare time.

This **Buddhabrot fractal** is one of my favorite examples. It visualizes the *probability distribution* of escape trajectories from the Mandelbrot set. By tracing millions of paths as they diverge, the image reveals a complex structure built from randomness — a beautiful intersection of math, probability, and art.

As a mathematician and data scientist, I’m passionate about connecting abstract theory to the real world — and sometimes, that connection becomes unexpectedly beautiful.
