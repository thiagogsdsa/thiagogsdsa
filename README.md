- 🔭 I’m currently working on

  > - **A/B testing design and analysis for decision science**
  > - **Brain tumor classification using deep learning and medical imaging**
  >
- 💡 Interested in statistical modeling, causal inference, graph theory, optimization, and real-world applications of NLP, machine learning, and deep learning.
- 🧠 Passionate about data science since 2022, when I first discovered its power and fell in love with the field
- 🌱 I'm currently learning about RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications, as you can see in my portfolio, and also exploring tools for model deployment. I'm committed to continuous learning and expanding my skill set.
- 👨‍💻 All of my projects are available at [github.com/thiagogsdsa](https://github.com/thiagogsdsa)
- 🌱 In my free time, I love exploring nature through hiking, attending cultural events, and diving into research papers on emerging theories. I enjoy going deeper into mathematics and building bridges between theory and real-world applications.
- 💬 Feel free to ask me about **Data Science**, **Machine Learning/Deep Learning**, **NLP**, and **Mathematics**
