# Data Science Projects 

### Operations Research 
#### Optimization Models

- **[production-mix-optimization](https://github.com/thiagogsdsa/mathematical-optimization-projects/tree/main)**

 Implementation of a classic linear programming model to optimize the production mix of a factory with resource constraints. The project includes formulating the problem mathematically, solving it using the PuLP library with the CBC solver, and performing sensitivity analysis to interpret shadow prices and slack variables. This project highlights skills in mathematical modeling, applied optimization, and integrating solver tools for practical decision-making in operations research.  
  *Tech:* Python, PuLP, CBC Solver, Linear Programming, Mathematical Modeling, Sensitivity Analysis

- **[facility-location-optimization](https://github.com/thiagogsdsa/mathematical-optimization-projects)**

Development of a facility location model formulated as a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem. The goal is to decide which facilities to open and how to assign customer demand to minimize fixed and transportation costs, while respecting capacity and demand constraints. The project includes an exact solution using PuLP and the CBC solver, a greedy heuristic for quick approximations, and a Simulated Annealing metaheuristic to find better solutions in larger instances. Demonstrates skills in mathematical modeling, exact and approximate optimization methods, and custom heuristic design.

*Tech:* Python, PuLP, CBC Solver, MILP, Greedy Heuristic, Simulated Annealing, Facility Location Modeling

#### Decision Analysis

- **[AHP-Based Candidate Ranking System](https://github.com/thiagogsdsa/ahp-candidate-ranking)**  
  Developed a rigorous multi-criteria decision-making framework using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to rank six candidates for a Data Scientist role. The project includes building pairwise comparison matrices, calculating criteria weights, checking consistency, and performing sensitivity analysis.  
  *Tech:* Python, NumPy, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook

### ðŸ¤– NLP & Applied AI

- **[faq-floripa](https://github.com/thiagogsdsa/faq-floripa)** â€” *A Smart Tourism Assistant Powered by RAG*  
  Developed a Telegram chatbot designed to assist tourists by answering frequently asked questions about FlorianÃ³polis. The system leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by retrieving relevant information from structured JSON datasets using sentence embeddings and cosine similarity. It then generates accurate, context-aware responses via the Groq API. This project demonstrates practical application of NLP, vector search, and modern AI APIs to build interactive, knowledge-driven assistants.  
  *Tech:* Python, Docker, Poetry, RAG, Groq API, sentence-transformers, JSON, linear algebra

###  Data Wrangling & Cleaning

- **[data-wrangling-python](https://github.com/thiagogsdsa/data-wrangling-python)**  
  A comprehensive repository featuring reusable Python scripts and tools aimed at cleaning, transforming, and preprocessing raw datasets efficiently. Focused on enabling data scientists to build robust, reproducible data pipelines and improve productivity in everyday data preparation tasks. This project illustrates best practices in data hygiene and prepares data for downstream analysis or machine learning.  
  *Tech:* Python, Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter Notebooks, Data Pipelines

### Future Projects
-  Fraud detection with Graph Neural Networks (GNN) 
-  A project combining Large Language Models (LLM) with optimization (Operations Research) 

### Remark:

> I also have worked on private projects, such as lead qualification and an NLP-based clustering model for grouping similar income statement layouts. Due to confidentiality, these projects cannot be shared publicly.

# App / Side Project

## Stock View Simulation Dashboard  

Demo: **[Stock View Simulation](https://stockviewsimulation.streamlit.app/)**

Watch the video: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9_vMD7R0ZQ)

It fetches stock data, performs calculations, and visualizes trends with interactive charts.  
- Enter a ticker symbol.
- Select the number of years of historical data.
- Visualize interactive charts of:
  - Closing prices
  - Opening prices
  - Volume
  - Candlestick charts
- Choose chart frequency: daily, weekly, or monthly.
- Analyze annual return distribution.
- View histograms of daily, weekly, and monthly returns.
- Simulate portfolio returns by specifying:
  - Investment amount
  - Date of contribution

**Tools:** Python, Streamlit, Matplotlib, mplfinance, Pandas, NumPy, yFinance  

## Triangle Breathing Dashboard

 Demo: **[Triangle Breathing](https://thiagogsdsa.github.io/breathing)** 

 Watch the video: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwT-EoZOaeI)

**Note:** This is **not a data science project**, but itâ€™s fun and practical!  
The app uses **SQL**, automates **Git commits and pushes**, runs a **shell script**, and even plays a Tibetan bell with meditation music in the terminal.  
You just need to respond `"1"` to indicate readiness.  
The system **saves your response in a database** and automatically updates the Git repository.  
This helps me **break hyperfocus** and take mindful breathing breaks, improving health and focus.

**Tools:** Python, SQLite, Shell Script, Plotly, Julia (for Bruddrabrot art)

## Explorations / Studies

### Integral Estimator (High Dimension) via Monte Carlo

[Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14urHqZzmSOkYSqrFQcxJpobUbX1gwQR8?usp=sharing)

Exploring: Connecting the theory of integration to practical applications, with examples including estimation of probabilities such as mechanical failure detection and simplified Bayesian A/B testing (see remark). The intention is to explore the full Bayesian A/B testing approach in detail later and deploy it for further use.


### Indicator Based on Percentiles

[Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qEiHHI-hYqjNihHlmReyX_msYaozKrGe?usp=sharing)

Exploring **alternatives to RSI and Stochastics** using **fitted percentiles (5 and 95)**.  
The approach investigates overbought and oversold regions based on **average log returns** and percentile thresholds. This is **exploratory analysis**, not a trading recommendation.

###  When Math Meets Art - Buddhabrot fractal
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thiagogsdsa/math/master/fractals/julia/Buddhabrot/output.gif" alt="Buddhabrot Fractal" />
</p>

While solving real business problems is my main focus â€” with an emphasis on cloud technologies, deployment, and sharp analytical skills â€” I also enjoy exploring the artistic side of mathematics in my spare time.

This **Buddhabrot fractal** is one of my favorite examples. It visualizes the *probability distribution* of escape trajectories from the Mandelbrot set. By tracing millions of paths as they diverge, the image reveals a complex structure built from randomness â€” a beautiful intersection of math, probability, and art.

Fractals are not just art! They are highly relevant in real-world applications, such as **medical imaging**, **agriculture**, and **complex system modeling**. Quite soon, I plan to explore some of these practical applications in depth.

As a mathematician and data scientist, Iâ€™m passionate about connecting abstract theory to the real world â€” and sometimes, that connection becomes unexpectedly beautiful.
