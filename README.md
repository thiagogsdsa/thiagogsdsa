# Projects 

 ### currently working on
   - **Bayesian A/B Testing: Experimental Design and Analysis for Decision-Making** *(80% complete)*
     
      Building a decision-making framework using Bayesian inference for evaluating A/B test results under uncertainty.

   - **Brain Tumor Classification Using Deep Learning and Medical Imaging** *(25% complete)*

       Exploring morphological features for extracting discriminative components from MRI images. Investigating an alternative to CNN-based models for classification.

### Completed Projects
-  **[faq-floripa](thiagogsdsa/faq-floripa) – FAQ-Floripa: A Smart Tourism Assistant Powered by RAG**
  
     **Description:** Developed a Telegram bot that answers tourists' questions about Florianópolis using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. I simulated JSON files with Q&A pairs, retrieved the most relevant information using sentence embeddings and inner product similarity, and fed this context into Groq for personalized responses.
   
     **Tools:** Python, Docker, Poetry, RAG, Groq API, sentence-transformers, JSON, linear algebra (inner product)

-  **[data-wrangling-python](https://github.com/thiagogsdsa/data-wrangling-python) – Data Wrangling & Cleaning Data**

   **Description:**  A growing  repository providing tools and scripts to support data scientists in repetitive and time-consuming data wrangling tasks. The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in data preprocessing while sharing helpful resources with the community.
   
   **Tools:** Python, Pandas, Regex, Jupyter, Docker, Poetry

  ### Future Projects
-  Fraud detection with Graph Neural Networks (GNN) 
-  A project combining Large Language Models (LLM) with optimization (Operations Research) 

### Remark:

> I also have worked on private projects, such as lead qualification and an NLP-based clustering model for grouping similar income statement layouts. Due to confidentiality, these projects cannot be shared publicly.

# More about me 
- I love tackling complex problems through applied mathematics and statistics. Challenges motivate me to dig deeper and explore innovative solutions beyond standard approaches. My strengths lie in analytical thinking, data-driven modeling, and continuous learning. While I focus mainly on analysis and modeling, I’m always eager to collaborate and grow my skills in deploying and productionizing solutions. I thrive in environments where creativity meets technical rigor to deliver impactful results.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning about RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications, as you can see in my portfolio, and also exploring tools for model deployment. I'm committed to continuous learning and expanding my skill set.
- 👨‍💻 All of my projects are available at [github.com/thiagogsdsa](https://github.com/thiagogsdsa)
- 🌱 In my free time, I love exploring nature through hiking, attending cultural events, and diving into research papers on emerging theories. I enjoy going deeper into mathematics and building bridges between theory and real-world applications.

# 🎨 When Math Meets Art
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thiagogsdsa/math/master/fractals/julia/Buddhabrot/output.gif" alt="Buddhabrot Fractal" />
</p>

While solving real business problems is my main focus — with an emphasis on cloud technologies, deployment, and sharp analytical skills — I also enjoy exploring the artistic side of mathematics in my spare time.

This **Buddhabrot fractal** is one of my favorite examples. It visualizes the *probability distribution* of escape trajectories from the Mandelbrot set. By tracing millions of paths as they diverge, the image reveals a complex structure built from randomness — a beautiful intersection of math, probability, and art.

As a mathematician and data scientist, I’m passionate about connecting abstract theory to the real world — and sometimes, that connection becomes unexpectedly beautiful.
