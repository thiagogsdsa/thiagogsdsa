<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Thiago</h1>
<h3 align="center">I'm a <em>Mathematician</em> with an <strong>MBA in Data Science</strong></h3>

- 🔭 I’m currently working on

  > - **A/B testing design and analysis for decision science**
  > - **Brain tumor classification using deep learning and medical imaging**
  >
- 💡 Interested in statistical modeling, causal inference, graph theory, optimization, and real-world applications of NLP, machine learning, and deep learning.
- 🧠 Passionate about data science since 2022, when I first discovered its power and fell in love with the field
- 🌱 I'm currently learning about RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications, as you can see in my portfolio, and also exploring tools for model deployment. I'm committed to continuous learning and expanding my skill set.
- 👨‍💻 All of my projects are available at [github.com/thiagogsdsa](https://github.com/thiagogsdsa)
- 🌱 In my free time, I love exploring nature through hiking, attending cultural events, and diving into research papers on emerging theories. I enjoy going deeper into mathematics and building bridges between theory and real-world applications.

### 🎨 When Math Meets Art
![Buddhabrot Fractal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thiagogsdsa/math/master/fractals/julia/Buddhabrot/output.gif)

While my top priority right now is solving real business problems — with a strong focus on cloud technologies, deployment, and sharpening hard skills — I also enjoy, as a side hobby, diving deep into mathematics and exploring connections between probability, art, and complex analysis.

As a mathematician, I love going beyond the surface of data science — from statistics to abstract theory — and finding beauty in how math can produce powerful, even artistic, visual results.

Even more intriguing is the **Buddhabrot fractal** — a stunning formation where each point in the image represents the *probability distribution* of escape trajectories from the Mandelbrot set. The image is built by tracing the paths of millions of points as they escape, and accumulating their frequency in each region of the complex plane. What emerges is a beautiful visual representation of probabilistic behavior across complex dynamics — a perfect blend of math, probability, and art.
