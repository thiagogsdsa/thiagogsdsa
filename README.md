# More about me 

- 🌱 I'm currently learning about RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications, as you can see in my portfolio, and also exploring tools for model deployment. I'm committed to continuous learning and expanding my skill set.
- 👨‍💻 All of my projects are available at [github.com/thiagogsdsa](https://github.com/thiagogsdsa)
- 🌱 In my free time, I love exploring nature through hiking, attending cultural events, and diving into research papers on emerging theories. I enjoy going deeper into mathematics and building bridges between theory and real-world applications.

# 🎨 When Math Meets Art
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thiagogsdsa/math/master/fractals/julia/Buddhabrot/output.gif" alt="Buddhabrot Fractal" />
</p>

While solving real business problems is my main focus — with an emphasis on cloud technologies, deployment, and sharp analytical skills — I also enjoy exploring the artistic side of mathematics in my spare time.

This **Buddhabrot fractal** is one of my favorite examples. It visualizes the *probability distribution* of escape trajectories from the Mandelbrot set. By tracing millions of paths as they diverge, the image reveals a complex structure built from randomness — a beautiful intersection of math, probability, and art.

As a mathematician and data scientist, I’m passionate about connecting abstract theory to the real world — and sometimes, that connection becomes unexpectedly beautiful.
